PUT YOUR RESUME IN THIS FOLDER
================================

1. Export your resume as a PDF.
2. Drop it in this folder.
3. Rename it to exactly this:

   resume.pdf

That's it. The download button on the Resume page will automatically pick it up.

Do NOT put it inside the images/ folder — it goes here, right next to it.

Your folder should look like this when done:

assets/
├── resume.pdf              ← your resume goes here
└── images/
    ├── project1.jpg
    ├── project2.jpg
    └── ...
